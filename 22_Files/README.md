# 22_Files - Simple file operation examples (students)

Run in order to practice:

| `01_write.py` | Write (w) - create/overwrite |
| `02_read.py` | Read all (r) |
| `03_append.py` | Append (a) to end |
| `04_read_lines.py` | Read line by line |
| `05_with.py` | Write with `with` |
| `06_exists.py` | Check if file exists |

| `08_read_for_enumerate.py` | Read with for + enumerate |
| `09_read_modify.py` | Read file, modify one student, write back |

**Suggested order:** 01 -> 02 -> 09 -> 02 (or 01 -> 02 -> 03 -> 02 -> 04 -> 05 -> 07 -> 08 -> 09)

All examples use `students.txt` with student data (name,major,gpa).
