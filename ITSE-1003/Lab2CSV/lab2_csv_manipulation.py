# Description: Lab 2 - CSV manipulation with csv.DictReader, summaries, filters, stretch output.
# -------------------------------------------------

# import csv module to read the csv file
import csv

# import pathlib module to create file paths
from pathlib import Path

# Paths next to this script (works regardless of current working directory)
_LAB_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent

# create file path for the csv file
CSV_PATH = _LAB_DIR / "lab2_students.csv"

# create file path for the summary file
SUMMARY_PATH = _LAB_DIR / "lab2_summary.txt"


# -------------------------------------------------
# Task 1 - Import and open the file
# -------------------------------------------------
with CSV_PATH.open(mode="r", newline="", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    # read the csv file using csv.DictReader
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)

# -------------------------------------------------
